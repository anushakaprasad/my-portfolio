# My First Portfolio Website

This is my very first web development project — a personal portfolio built using only **HTML** 
It’s a simple static webpage that includes the core sections like **About Me**, **Education**, **Skills**, and a **Contact Form**.

-Includes:
  - Structured sections (About, Education, Skills, etc.)
