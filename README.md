#  My First Portfolio Website

This is my **very first web development project** â€” a personal portfolio built using **only HTML** (for now!).  
It's a simple static webpage that includes basic sections like About Me, Projects, and Contact Info.



##  Project Overview

-  Built using pure **HTML5**
-  CSS is **coming soon** as I continue learning styling!
-  Contains basic webpage structure: headings, paragraphs, links, etc.
